# About The Plug-in Community Guide

This document started as an internal document that Craig Oda wrote 
to help Jesse Casman with meetings at CES 2018 in Las Vegas.  Craig
and Jesse found 
out that Ricoh was planning to announce a radical, new strategy for 
360 cameras. In January of 2018, Ricoh announced plans to open 
up the internal Android operating system
to external developers.

We immediately saw the potential to change how people approached VR 
and AR.  

At CES, we gained access to unlocked THETA V cameras under the
closed beta program that Ricoh offered developers. As we worked
with the community on building applications, this document grew.

## Craig
After growing up in the US, I started my career in Tokyo, where I was part of the
core team that developed the first public-access Internet system in Asia.
I co-founded the Tokyo Linux Users Group, served as first president, and co-authored a book
for O'Reilly Japan on adding Japanese language support to Linux. After selling my Internet business
to a large US firm, I moved to the US to start the US office of a Linux company and helped
to raise $96M in venture funding. I stayed in Palo Alto and continue to work with cool
technology companies changing the world.

VR is not new, but the business opportunities for VR are new, enabled by cheaper and
better technology. Although there's buzz about the entertainment potential of VR, the main
opportunity may be in how people communicate large amounts of visual and auditory data
with each other. We are overwhelmed by media. We need interactive ways
to assess and focus in on the details that are meaningful. 360 media offers a way to
capture and work with large amounts of information. Join us as we navigate, define, and build
this new paradigm.

## Jesse

Hello from San Francisco! This is Jesse (jcasman@oppkey.com), I've been working with Craig on the theta360.guide since 2015. We build projects and tutorials, connect with developers like you, and try to have a good time while we're doing it. Part of that is building usable documentation like this THETA V Plugin Development Community Guide! The Guide is constantly being updated as we test more and learn more. If you notice something that could be fixed or added, we'd love to hear from you. It's a community effort! The RICOH THETA is an extremely cool platform for development, with potential in so many different industries. If you're doing something in 360, let us know, and maybe consider adding it here to help out others.
