# About The Plug-in Community Guide

This document started as an internal document that Craig Oda wrote 
to help Jesse Casman with meetings at CES 2018 in Las Vegas.  Craig
and Jesse found 
out that Ricoh was planning to announce a radical, new strategy for 
360 cameras. In January of 2018, Ricoh announced plans to open 
up the internal Android operating system
to external developers.

We immediately saw the potential to change how people approached VR 
and AR.  

At CES, we gained access to unlocked THETA V cameras under the
closed beta program that Ricoh offered developers. As we worked
with the community on building applications, this document grew.
